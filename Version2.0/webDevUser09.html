            <h2>What is Slope?</h2>
            <p>The Slope of a fun is the amount the total Y/Function value changes for every set amounnt the X increases.<small>(Note that this is really only 100% true with linear function)</small> In a linear function the way you find what the slope is is by plugging in <sup>y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub></sub></sub>.</p>
            <h2>What is a Ratio</h2>
            <p>A Ratio is like a slope, except instead it's the amount the total value of the function is multiplied by per consistent increase to the X value. The way you find the common ratio is by plugging in <sup>y<sub>2</sub>/y<sub>1</sub></sup>&frasl;<sub>x<sub>2</sub>/x<sub>1</sub></sub></sub></p>

<h1>What is a Function?</h1>
<section>
    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p>A Function in math is an equation that has an input and an output. This means that for every number you plug into the function, you will get a number as an "output". X in the case of most basic functions are the number that we are "plugging in". Meaning we are changing the value of X and the output is the total value of the equations after we change x to that number.</p>

<section>
    <h2>How would you use this?</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of basic ways we could, you could write a function to measure the amount you get payed per paycheck. If your paycheck was every week you could set it so that X represents a day, and Y represents the amount you make. You could then see how much you would make every seven days depending on how many days you go by on the function, or even look at how much you would technically be making per a set amount of time, even if you don't get paid at those times.</p>
    <p>There is so much more stuff you can use functions for, that is just an obvious example I can think of.</p>
